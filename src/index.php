							IPAR (Imaging, Preserving, analyzing and reporting) is a narrative-based detective-themed
							adventure <a href="files/IPAR Game 1.01.zip">game</a>, which has two versions. One runs on Windows 7 or newer with the .NET framework installed, and the other can be run in most modern browsers. Through the
							game, the player assumes the role of an
							investigator and collects evidence, answers questions, and draws conclusions as part
							of a simulated investigation. Players are guided through a series of scripted steps,
							allowing them to gain practical experience
							and draw their own conclusions by answering
							subject related questions.

							that can be used to generate new cases. Everything from subject matter to graphical
							elements to story can be set by the user to create an entertaining educational experience, and an <a href="files/IPAR Reader.zip">reader</a> that
							allows instructors to view the reports submitted by students for grading.

							Sample case files for the game can be downloaded on the <a href="/downloads.php">downloads</a> page. These files may be downloaded and played in the web or Windows game.
