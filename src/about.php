                        <p>IPAR (Imaging, Preserving, analyzing and reporting) is a narrative-based detective-themed adventure game. In the game, the player assumes the role of an investigator: collecting evidence, answering questions, and drawing conclusions as part of a simulated investigation. Players are guided through a series of scripted steps, allowing them to gain practical experience and draw their own conclusions by answering subject related questions.</p>

                                These innovative modules will be built into games in a real computing environment that has direct access to latest forensics software. In addition, the gamesâ€™ integrated graphical visualizations will help entry-level students understand intangible and inaccessible abstract concepts, such as deleted/hidden/encrypted/over-written digital evidence.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Develop faculty expertise, targeting two-year college faculty, in digital forensics and security field through collaborations within and between partnering institutions (Faculty Goal).</p></li>
                            <li><p>Disseminate the game-based forensics course modules to community colleges and universities through workshops, tutorials/panels, websites such as the ATE Centers, published papers and conference presentations (Dissemination Goal).</p></li>
                            <li><p>Assess the effectiveness of the games-based course modules via a comprehensive evaluation plan utilizing an external evaluator and a variety of data sources (Assessment Goal). The Assessment and Evaluation (A&amp;E) plan covers the effectiveness of each module in achieving its outcomes for students and faculty using a pre-post test comparison. The four major project goals listed above will be assessed through a well-crafted A&amp;E plan.</p></li>

    	    			<p>Funded in part by the National Science Foundation under Award DUE-1400567, RIT faculty have been working
    	    				with Onondaga Community College and Corning Community College to develop a sequence
    	    				of entertaining, engaging, and educational forensic games, suitable for first year
    	    				students in college. Following narrative and/or storylines of the game via interactive
    	    				dialogs and visualized abstract concepts, students are motivated and engaged to obtain
    	    			the necessary knowledge. </p>
    	    			<p>The forensic game framework is modular and flexible and can easily
    	    				be applied to other areas of STEM programs. A GUI-based game creator
    	    				is developed to assist easy creation of new games for different
    	    				domains.
