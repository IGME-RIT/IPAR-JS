			<questionName>Creating an Image</questionName>
			<instructions>Use FTK imager to create a forensic duplication of a USB device assuming the USB device is connected via a write-blocker.
1) Plug in a USB drive.
2) Launch FTK Imager from the Toolbox folder on the desktop.
3) Choose File &gt; Create Disk Image.
4) Choose physical drive and click next.
5) Select the USB drive from drop-down and click "Finish".
6) Click the "Add" button to add to the list of destinations.
7) Select "Raw (dd)" and click next.
8) At Evidence Item Information you can enter case information or skip to the next step.
9) For the image Destination folder, browse to and select the desktop.
10) Enter your own name for "Image Filename".
11) Uncheck the 'use AD Encryption' box.
12) Click "Finish" to return to the Create Image menu and press Start to create the image.

When this process is finished, two new files should appear on your desktop.

			<instructions>Your Task</instructions>
			<questionText>Dear Detective,

As you know, digital forensics involves four steps: 
1. Create a forensic image of an evidence, 2. Preserve the evidence making sure that no one has changed the image, 3. Analyze the image to find pertinent evidence to either support or dispel the charge, 4. Report your conclusion along with supporting evidence.

For this case, we first want to test your capability of creating an image. After you pass this test, you will be given an already acquired image for the Dishonesty case. Your job is to verify that the image has not been changed, then analyze the image and submit a report to provide your opinion on this case.

Good Luck,
Boss

			<questionName>Verify that the evidence image has not been modified.</questionName>
			<instructions>The evidence is considered void and is not admissible in the court if it has been modified during the investigation. Therefore, it is important to verify its integrity.
To verify the given evidence has not been modified, we want to make sure that both md5 and sha1 values (the fingerprints of the evidence) are unchanged.  Read "Preserve Evidence" document provided under resources.

Verify the integrity of provided evidence image:

1) Run FTK Imager and load the Dishonesty Case.001 image file that was provided to you into FTK Imager by selecting File &gt; Add Evidence Item.
2) Choose "Image File" and click next. 
3) Browse for the Dishonesty Case.001 image file and click "Finish".
4) Select File &gt; Verify Drive/Image. A window containing hash numbers should now be visible.
   
In this case, when the Dishonesty Case.001 image were created, these were the sequences that this method produced:
MD5  :    a685e69aeb3b3f91bb8946c6c97eac34
SHA1 :    699f1de53fb5989ff71818aff16207645de1643a

Compare these sequences with those returned by the program.</instructions>
			<questionText>How do you verify your copy is valid? Justify your answer.</questionText>
			<answer>md5 of the image = provided md5, and sha1 of the image = provided sha1</answer>
			<answer>md5 of the copy = provided md5</answer>
			<answer>sha1 of the copy = provided sha1</answer>
			<answer>they are always the same</answer>
			<answer>A, B and C</answer>
			<feedback>check all options</feedback>
			<feedback>What if md5 collision happies?</feedback>
			<feedback>What if sha1 collision happies?</feedback>
			<feedback>Really? Why we need to preserve evidence?</feedback>
			<feedback>Choice B and choice C alone will not serve the purpose due to collision.</feedback>

			<instructions>Forensic Analysis Tools</instructions>
			<questionText>Congratulations, Detective! You have passed the Create-image and Preserve phases. Now you move on to the analysis phase!

We have created a forensic image called Dishonesty Case.001 located in Desktop\Cases\ folder. Your job is to used forensics tools to analyze this image and provide a report on your findings.

There are many forensic analysis tools available.
EnCase from Guidance Software, Forensic Toolkit (FTK) from AccessData, and open source tool Autopsy/Sleuthkit are among the most popular forensic tools used in forensics investigation. In this exercise, you will use Autopsy for your analysis.
