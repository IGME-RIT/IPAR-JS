						<h2>Project Goals</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p class="larger2">
									Develop a sequence of fun, entertaining, yet educational game-based digital forensics modules to enhance digital
									forensics curricula and help create a pathway for students in forensics programs from two-year
									colleges to four-year institutes (Curricular Goal). <br/>These innovative modules will be built into games
									in a real computing environment that has direct access to latest forensics software. In addition, the gamesâ€™
									integrated graphical visualizations will help entry-level students understand intangible and inaccessible
									abstract concepts, such as deleted/hidden/encrypted/over-written digital evidence.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="larger2">
									Develop faculty expertise, targeting two-year college faculty, in digital forensics and security
									field through collaborations within and between partnering institutions (Faculty Goal).
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="larger2">
									Disseminate the game-based forensics course modules to community colleges and universities through workshops,
									tutorials/panels, websites such as the ATE Centers, published papers and conference presentations (Dissemination Goal).
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="larger2">
									Assess the effectiveness of the games-based course modules via a comprehensive evaluation plan utilizing an external
									evaluator and a variety of data sources (Assessment Goal).	<br/>The Assessment and Evaluation (A&E) plan
									covers the effectiveness of each module in achieving its outcomes for students and faculty using a pre-post test comparison.
									The four major project goals listed above will be assessed through a well-crafted A&E plan
