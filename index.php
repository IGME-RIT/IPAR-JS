							IPAR (Imaging, Preserving, analyzing and reporting) is a narrative-based detective-themed
							adventure <a href="files/IPAR Game.zip">game</a>, which has two versions. One runs on Windows 7 or newer with the .NET framework installed, and the other can be run in most modern browsers. Through the
							game, the player assumes the role of an
							investigator and collects evidence, answers questions, and draws conclusions as part
							of a simulated investigation. Players are guided through a series of scripted steps,
							allowing them to gain practical experience
							and draw their own conclusions by answering
							subject related questions.
